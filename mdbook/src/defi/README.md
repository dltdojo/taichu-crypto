```
 1. The smart contract security seems legit.
 2. Compound is a CUSTODIAL system, all lending pools can be trivially drained 
    if their admin private key is compromised.
 3. When you lend on Compound, you are NOT guaranteed to be able to withdraw 
    whenever you want. If you try to withdraw your funds and all the money is 
    locked up in outstanding loans, your withdrawal transaction will fail.

> Even today our users experience the limitations of speed, throughput, and cost of the Ethereum blockchain, limiting the use of Centrifuge OS to very specific types of product lines, services, and transactions. Privacy-preserving features are not yet sufficiently available on Ethereum, additionally limiting business and enterprise use-cases.
