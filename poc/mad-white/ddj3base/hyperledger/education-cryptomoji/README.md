# Hyperledger Cryptomoji

This educational curriculum includes a quick intro to blockchains generally,
before diving into distributed application development by guiding students
through building their own [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/about)
clone built with
[Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth) and
Javascript. It follows a bootcamp "sprint" format, providing a stub
application for students to implement themselves and extensive tests to guide
their work.

Created in collaboration with [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com).

## Prerequisites

This project requires [Node 8](https://nodejs.org/) and
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).


## Sections

This curriculum is broken into two parts. Although they build on one another,
if you are already familiar with blockchain basics, you can probably skip part
one. For detailed instructions for each part, head to their individual
READMEs.

### Part One: DIY Blockchain

**README:** [code/part-one/README.md](code/part-one/README.md)

**Duration:** 5-10 hours

**Concepts:**
- Basic blockchain structure
- Hashing
- Signing
- Consensus

Part one introduces you to general blockchain concepts by walking you through
building your own. You should finish with basic working knowledge of hashing,
signing, consensus algorithms, and the blockchain data structure itself.

### Part Two: Sawtooth Cryptomoji

**README:** [code/part-two/README.md](code/part-two/README.md)

**Duration:** 20-40 hours

**Concepts:**
- Hyperledger Sawtooth overview
- Writing clients
    - Building transactions and batches
    - Interacting with the Sawtooth REST API
- Writing transaction processors
    - Reading and writing state
    - Validating payloads

Part two is the actual Cryptomoji app. It should give you a detailed
understanding of how to build both clients and "transaction processors" on
Hyperledger Sawtooth. When you're done, you will have a working full-stack
application ready to be deployed on a Sawtooth blockchain.

### Solution Code

In addition to the prompts and stub functions in the `master` branch, this repo
includes a `solution` branch with completed versions of both sections. This
branch is a way for students to check their work and become familiar with
current best practices. If your intention is to complete the sprint, we
recommended that you do _not_ use the solution code as a way to get yourself
unstuck. At least attempt every prompt. If necessary, seek guidance from
resources like
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hyperledger-sawtooth)
or Sawtooth's [official chat](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth)
before looking in the back of the book for the answers.
